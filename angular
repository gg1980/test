=================================== ES6/ECMAScript 6 ================================================
-- This is created to standardized JavaScript. This is the specification and javascript is the implemnation 
    --Blocked scoped variables
        - Old way to use -> 'var'
        - New way -> 'let'
        - New way -> 'const'
    -- Class
        class People
        {
            constructor()
            {This is constructor}
            listPerson()
            {This is method}
        }
    -- Arrow functions
       old way --> var name = function (){}
       new way --> var name = ()=>{}
    -- Templates
       `Back Quote
       Old way 
              var name = 'Edwin'
              var age = 30
              console.log(name +'s age is ' + age);
       New way
              let name = 'Edwin'
              let age = 30
              console.log (`${name}'s age is ${age}`)
    -- Desctructing
    -- Modules
        Modules in ES6 are files that allows code and data to be isolated, it helps in organizing the grouping of code logically
        They are also called packages or libraries
        export constant Name = 'Edwin'
        
        import Name from './someFile';
=================================== TypeScript ================================================
TypeScript is superset of JavaScript means a wrapper or layer with more features. We have file.ts its being compiled by complier 
into JavaScript

Features
        - Types
            let name: string; //example
            let isDone: boolean;
            let posts: number[] = [1,2,3];
            let notsure: any ='Hi 78';
            number, string[], boolean, string, any
        - Interfaces
            With interfaces we can define how our data or functionalities should be modeled
            interface Post{
                title: string;
            }
        - Decorators
            Decorators are functionsl that are invoked with prefixed @Symbol for example @Component
            They return the same things that was passed in but modify the data in some way
            We can decorate, Classes, Methods, Properties and Parameters
            
 
Plus all the ES6 features like clases, arrows functions, modules, block scoped variables
=================================== Info ================================================
-- package.json - Basic information and list of dependencies that are required to run the project. This is done by CLI.
-- TypeScript gets compiled into JavaScript
-- @ declarative -> LIke @Component is declartive
-- main.ts - This is incharge of bootstraping whole application
              In this AppModule is being imported and then passing it to bootstrapModule(AppModule)

-- index.html -> This is the starting body
<body>
    <app-root></app-root> // This app-root is defined app.component.ts (@Component -> selector:'app-root')
</body>

-- We write the code in the components (ts stands for TypeScript)
    a) app.components.ts [THIS IS THE CLASS where we write elements, objects etc and it talks with HTML the view layer]
                         - Constructutor are used to inject dependencies from other modules
                         - ngOnInit - These are the methods lifeCycle 
    b) app.components.html [This is the view layer]
    c) app.components.css [This is the CSS file]
    d) app.module.ts - Module wraps everything and module is being bootstraped via (main.ts)
                       All the components needs to be registed to this AppModule as its being bootstrapped
                       (import it and then registed under @NgModule)
                       Inside this we also tell which component is the bootstrap component like bootstrap:[AppComponent]
    e) app.components.spec.ts [This is testing file]
    
    Modules -> Components -> Selector/Template/CSS
    
-- String Interpolation -> In the HTML (View) we show the data as {{ name }}  - This name is defined in the component
-- Tertary operation -> {{city ? city:'No City'}}
-- Property Binding
                  Active <input type="radio" id="status" [checked]="status">
                  using [] -> This is being binded with variable 'status' defined in component module
-- Event Binding
                <button (click)="greetPerson()">Click</button>
                <div style="height: 200px; width: 200px;border: 1px solid" (mouseover)="greetPerson()"></div>
         
-- Two way binding: If you change something in the front-hand it changes in backhand and vice-versa
                <input [(ngModel)]="lastName" type="text" id="lastName">            
                  
=================================== Commands ================================================
-- https://github.com/angular/angular-cli
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new demo -----> (Creation of new project name called demo)
ng serve ----> (Go inside the project and this command will server)
ng build --> To build the application (DIST folder is created)
ng g c example (creation of generate component named 'example')
