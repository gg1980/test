=================================== Info ================================================
-- package.json - Basic information and list of dependencies that are required to run the project. This is done by CLI.
-- TypeScript gets compiled into JavaScript
-- @ declarative -> LIke @Component is declartive
-- main.ts - This is incharge of bootstraping whole application
              In this AppModule is being imported and then passing it to bootstrapModule(AppModule)

-- index.html -> This is the starting body
<body>
    <app-root></app-root> // This app-root is defined app.component.ts (@Component -> selector:'app-root')
</body>

-- We write the code in the components (ts stands for TypeScript)
    a) app.components.ts [THIS IS THE CLASS where we write elements, objects etc and it talks with HTML the view layer]
    b) app.components.html [This is the view layer]
    c) app.components.css [This is the CSS file]
    d) app.module.ts - Module wraps everything and module is being bootstraped via (main.ts)
                       All the components needs to be registed to this AppModule as its being bootstrapped
                       (import it and then registed under @NgModule)
                       Inside this we also tell which component is the bootstrap component like bootstrap:[AppComponent]
    e) app.components.spec.ts [This is testing file]
    
    Modules -> Components -> Selector/Template/CSS
